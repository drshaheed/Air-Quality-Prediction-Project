# Regression-Repo

# Regression Analysis Project
This project is an example of how to perform regression analysis using Python. We'll be using the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information about various housing characteristics in the Boston area. Our goal is to build a regression model that can predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in each census tract.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.6 or later
    Jupyter Notebook (optional)

Data Description

The Boston Housing dataset contains the following variables:

    CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
    ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
    INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
    NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
    AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
    TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
    B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
    LSTAT: % lower status of the population
    MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we'll explore the Boston Housing dataset to gain a better understanding of the data.
Data Preprocessing

In this section, we'll preprocess the Boston Housing dataset to prepare it for regression analysis.
Model Building

In this section, we'll build a regression model using the preprocessed Boston Housing dataset.
Model Evaluation

In this section, we'll evaluate the performance of our regression model.
Conclusion

In this project, we've demonstrated how to perform regression analysis using Python. We started by exploring the Boston Housing dataset, then preprocessed the data, built a regression model, and evaluated its performance. With some tweaking, this project can be customized to analyze other datasets and perform different types of regression analysis.
