Predicting Air Quality

Air pollution is a major concern for public health worldwide, and accurate prediction of air quality is important for environmental management and public health planning. In this project, we will train a machine learning model to predict air quality based on various environmental features such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

# Dataset

The dataset we will use is the Air Quality dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains hourly air quality measurements from May 1998 to April 2004 in the city of Rome, Italy. 

The dataset includes the following variables:

    Date: The date and time of the measurement
    Time: The time of the measurement
    CO(GT): Carbon monoxide concentration in mg/m^3
    PT08.S1(CO): Tin oxide sensor (gas sensitive) resistance value in ppm
    NMHC(GT): Non-methane hydrocarbons concentration in microg/m^3
    C6H6(GT): Benzene concentration in microg/m^3
    PT08.S2(NMHC): Titania/zeolite sensor (gas sensitive) resistance value in ppm
    NOx(GT): Nitrogen oxides concentration in ppb
    PT08.S3(NOx): Tungsten oxide sensor (gas sensitive) resistance value in ppm
    NO2(GT): Nitrogen dioxide concentration in microg/m^3
    PT08.S4(NO2): Tungsten oxide sensor (indirect) resistance value in ppm
    PT08.S5(O3): Indium oxide sensor (gas sensitive) resistance value in ppm
    T: Temperature in Celsius
    RH: Relative humidity (%)
    AH: Absolute humidity

# Source of Data

The Air Quality dataset is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was originally created by the Department of Physics, University of Brescia, Italy, and the dataset can be downloaded from the following link:

# Conclusion
By training a machine learning model on this dataset, we can predict the air quality based on various environmental features and potentially identify factors that contribute to poor air quality.
