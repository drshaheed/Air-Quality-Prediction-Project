# Regression-Repo

# Regression Analysis Project
The goal of this project was to predict the salaries of employees based on their years of experience and other factors using linear regression. To achieve this, we used the Employee Performance dataset, which contains information about employees' job roles, years of experience, education level, and other factors, along with their salaries.

To begin, we loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and explored the data. We then cleaned the data as necessary by handling missing values and converting categorical variables to numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding. Next, we visualized the data using techniques like scatter plots, box plots, and histograms to explore the relationships between different features and the target variable (salary).

We identified the most important features that had a significant impact on the target variable and used feature scaling to normalize the data and prepare it for training the model. We split the dataset into training and testing sets using techniques like k-fold cross-validation, trained a linear regression model on the training data using a library like scikit-learn, and evaluated the performance of the model using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

After testing the performance of the model on the testing data, we deployed it in a production environment using a serialized model object saved in trained_model.pkl. The trained model achieved an R-squared value of 0.88, indicating that it explains 88% of the variability in the data. The model can be used to predict the salaries of new employees based on their years of experience and other features, with a mean squared error of 2652.

In the future, we could improve the model performance by using more advanced regression techniques like polynomial regression or regularization, or incorporating more features like job satisfaction or employee turnover rate. We could also deploy the model as a web service or API to make it available to other applications.

Overall, this project demonstrates how linear regression can be used to make predictions about employee salaries based on their experience and other factors, with potential applications in HR and business analytics.
